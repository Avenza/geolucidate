* 0.1
  Initial public release.

* 0.2
  Added documentation and two test cases.

* 0.3
  Correct handling of decimal fractions of minutes, and update
  documentation accordingly.
  Treat 'seconds' values over 59 as being a decimal fraction of
  minutes (that is, they are divided by 100 rather than 60).
  Address a parsing bug for coordinates of the form "N 5930 W 12330",
  where the direction comes first and is followed by a space.

* 0.4
  Accomodate coordinates with single-digit minutes.
